üåø AyuRaksha
üìå Project Overview

AyuRaksha is a web-based platform designed to promote the safe use and management of medicines by both individuals and pharmacies. The system provides a structured way to track medicines, manage pharmacy records, and prevent the risks associated with expired drugs. One of the unique aspects of the project is the integration of a chatbot, which allows users to identify pills and get quick responses to medical queries in an interactive manner.

The platform caters to two types of users: individuals and pharmacies. While individuals can register to monitor their own medicines, pharmacies are given tools to efficiently manage their inventory and ensure that expired medicines are properly tracked. By combining user-friendly design, database support, and chatbot integration, AyuRaksha aims to be a reliable digital health companion.

‚ú® Key Features

For individual users, the system allows registration using details such as name, date of birth, email, and location. Once registered, individuals can create their profile and add medicines to track expiry dates. The system can notify them when a medicine is close to expiring, thus reducing health risks and ensuring safer usage. Additionally, individuals can access the chatbot to ask questions, identify pills, and receive useful health information quickly.

For pharmacies, the platform offers a registration system that requires pharmacy details like name, registration number, location, and email. Pharmacies can maintain records of their stock, manage expiring medicines, and make sure that customers receive medicines that are within their validity period. This not only ensures compliance but also builds trust with their customers.

A standout feature is the chatbot integration, represented on the homepage as a floating pill-shaped button. When clicked, it redirects the user to a chatbot interface hosted on a Flask backend. The chatbot can identify pills, share relevant medical information, and answer common medicine-related queries. This adds an interactive and accessible layer to the project, making it more engaging for users.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The project is built using a modern and lightweight tech stack. The frontend is implemented using HTML, CSS (with TailwindCSS), and JavaScript, ensuring a clean, responsive design. The backend leverages Firebase Authentication for secure signup and login, along with Firebase Realtime Database for storing and managing user and pharmacy data. The chatbot is built with Python (Flask framework), providing a robust and flexible backend for natural language interaction. Additional tools such as GitHub for version control and VS Code for development make the workflow seamless.
